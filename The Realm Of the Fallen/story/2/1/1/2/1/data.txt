You head out towards the marketplace yourself. You often wonder why orcs make such a big deal out of archery. They have their own leaderboard and frequent tournaments. You participate to earn some quick cash. But here's the interesting part - even though the people of Daggerford love archery, they suck at it. You exploit that and win almost every tournament. No wonder you're at the top of the leaderboard. Kruger has now got you fired up, to see some real competition. You also wonder who this strange new person might be. Daggerford is as far away from any human settlement as it can be. The nearest is your former village to the north, which is about a couple of hundred miles away. The two villages are separated by thick dense forests which are home to a lot of different creatures. Therefore no one dares to cross the forest. There's another path that goes through the hilly ranges that run along the forest but the distance increases upto six times. There's also the Southern Stronghold. It is just a few miles off the goblin settlement of Pliqoris. The people of Daggerford pay their taxes to the Stronghold. But you don't think that there's any way someone from the fortress would come to this village. It's not that they are scared, it is more because of the disgust they have for any race other than humans. Moreover orcs are just seen as a brute and mindless race by the king. It has not been outrightly asserted but you've read about the several conflicts that the royal guard has had with the orc villages all over the kingdom and about how the king put down the requests of the combined Shaman leader of the villages time and time again.
You wonder where this mysterious person might be from.
